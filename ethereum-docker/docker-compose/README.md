environment settings specifications:

- datadir of ethereum, in which cluster peers data will be put in it
  - CLUSTER_DATADIR=/ethcluster
- ethereum network id, pls make sure all cluster's network id be identical
  - NETWORK_ID=779977
- number of peer instances generated in the cluster, if RAM<3G pls set it smaller then 4 
  - CLUSTER_INSTANCE_NUM=4
- if this cluster first peer instance be assigned as the boot node, there should be exactly one cluster set the property as Y in one network with the same network id
  - CLUSTER_BOOT_NODE=Y
- if this cluster all peers be miner, if set Y all peers in the cluster will starting mining process
  - CLUSTER_MINING=N
- the cluster id of the cluster peer instances, set from 0,1,2,3,...
  - CLUSTER_ID=0
- the cluster share dir to put bootnode-ip and genesis file and ethash which are all the same for all peers in all clusters
  - CLUSTER_SHAREDIR=/ethcluster_share    
- ip address specified for the cluster, be sure it's a ip address which is in the ipv4 docker network specified
  - CLUSTER_HOST_IP=172.16.238.10
      
      #################INIT_CONFIG SETTING###################
      
- Y - recreate accounts, nodes and nodes data with/without genesis file based on GENESIS_FILE_ENABLED flag
- N - no accounts, nodes and nodes data regeneration if not the first time initialization nodes and accounts
- GENESIS_BLOCK_REGEN - no accounts regeneration, but nodes and nodes data will be regenerated with/without genesis file based on GENESIS_FILE_ENABLED flag
  - INIT_CONFIG=GENESIS_BLOCK_REGEN
- all peers in the same cluster will using genesis file to create the genesis block
  - GENESIS_FILE_ENABLED=Y
- a valid and accessible genesis file when GENESIS_FILE_ENABLED is Y, otherwise no genesis file used to generate the first genesis block
  - GENESIS_FILE=/ethcluster_share/genesis-779977.json
